git commit -m "Mobile Image Loading Optimization v2.10.6

- ENHANCED: Mobile-specific image loading reliability
- ADDED: Mobile-optimized retry mechanisms
- IMPROVED: Mobile network handling and timeouts
- ENHANCED: Mobile preloading with staggered loading
- UPDATED: Version tag to v2.10.6

Mobile Image Loading Improvements:
- Added mobile-specific timeout (5s vs 3s for desktop)
- Enhanced retry delays for mobile networks (1s vs 0.5s)
- Added CORS handling for mobile browsers
- Implemented async image decoding for mobile
- Added mobile-specific preloading optimizations

Mobile-Specific Optimizations:
- Longer timeouts for mobile networks (5 seconds)
- Extended retry delays (1 second between attempts)
- CORS handling with crossOrigin='anonymous'
- Async image decoding for better performance
- Staggered preloading to avoid network overload

Technical Enhancements:
- Mobile detection and specific handling
- Enhanced error logging with mobile/desktop indicators
- Progressive retry mechanisms for mobile
- Network-friendly preloading strategies
- Better mobile browser compatibility

Mobile Network Handling:
- 5-second timeouts for mobile networks
- 1-second retry delays for mobile
- 3 preload retries for mobile (vs 2 for desktop)
- 200ms staggered preloading for mobile
- 1.5-second preload retry delays for mobile

User Experience:
- Reduced mobile image loading failures
- Better handling of slow mobile networks
- Improved mobile browser compatibility
- Enhanced debugging for mobile issues
- More reliable image display on mobile

Error Handling:
- Mobile-specific error logging
- Enhanced retry attempt tracking
- Better timeout management for mobile
- Improved fallback mechanisms
- Mobile-optimized error recovery

Ready for reliable mobile image loading!"
