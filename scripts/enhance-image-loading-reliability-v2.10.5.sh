git commit -m "Enhance Image Loading Reliability v2.10.5

- ENHANCED: Image loading with retry mechanisms
- ADDED: Automatic retry for failed image loads
- IMPROVED: Preloading with retry functionality
- ENHANCED: Error handling and user feedback
- UPDATED: Version tag to v2.10.5

Image Loading Reliability Improvements:
- Added 3-attempt retry mechanism for image loading
- Increased timeout from 2s to 3s with retry logic
- Enhanced preloading with 2-attempt retry system
- Better error logging and debugging information
- Improved user experience with retry feedback

Retry Mechanism Details:
- Main loading: 3 attempts with 3-second timeouts
- Preloading: 2 attempts with 1-second delays
- Automatic retry on network failures
- Progressive error logging for debugging
- Graceful fallback to placeholders

Technical Enhancements:
- Recursive retry functions for both loading and preloading
- Timeout management with proper cleanup
- Error state tracking and reporting
- Console logging for debugging and monitoring
- Improved error recovery strategies

User Experience:
- Reduced image loading failures
- Better feedback during loading attempts
- Automatic recovery from temporary network issues
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- More reliable image display

Error Handling:
- Comprehensive error logging
- Retry attempt tracking
- Timeout management
- Fallback mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages

Ready for reliable image loading!"
