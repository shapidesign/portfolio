- FIXED: Videos now pause when project modal closes
- ADDED: Video pause functionality to closeProjectModal()
- ENHANCED: User experience - no more background video playback
- UPDATED: Version tag to v2.9.7

Video Pause Functionality:
- Automatically pauses all videos when modal closes

- Only pauses videos that are currently playing

Exit Methods Covered:
- Close button (X) click

- Touch outside modal (mobile)
- Escape key press
- Any other method that calls closeProjectModal()

Technical Implementation:
- Added video pause logic to closeProjectModal() function
- Uses querySelectorAll('video') to find all videos in modal
- Checks if video is playing (!video.paused) before pausing
- Console logging for debugging and monitoring

User Experience:
- No more background video noise when modal closes
- Clean exit from project viewing
- Consistent behavior across all devices

Ready for seamless video interaction!"
