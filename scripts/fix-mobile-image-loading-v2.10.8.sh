git commit -m "Fix Mobile Image Loading v2.10.8

- FIXED: Mobile image loading failures
- ENHANCED: Mobile-specific timeout and retry mechanisms
- ADDED: Mobile image loading optimizations
- IMPROVED: Mobile network handling and error recovery
- UPDATED: Version tag to v2.10.8

Mobile Image Loading Fixes:
- Increased mobile timeout from 5s to 8s for slow networks
- Extended mobile retry delays from 1s to 2s
- Added mobile-specific error handling (onabort events)
- Enhanced mobile image attributes (loading='eager')
- Added critical image preloading for mobile

Enhanced Mobile Optimizations:
- 8-second timeouts for mobile networks (vs 3s desktop)
- 2-second retry delays for mobile recovery
- Mobile-specific error handling for aborted requests
- Eager loading for mobile images
- Critical image preloading with 500ms delays

Mobile Network Handling:
- Longer timeouts for slow mobile networks
- Extended retry delays for network recovery
- Abort event handling for mobile browsers
- Staggered critical image preloading
- Enhanced mobile debugging and logging

Technical Improvements:
- Mobile-specific image rendering optimizations
- Backface visibility hidden for mobile performance
- Critical image preloading for faster mobile loading
- Enhanced error tracking for mobile issues
- Better mobile browser compatibility

User Experience:
- Reduced mobile image loading failures
- Better handling of slow mobile networks
- Improved mobile browser compatibility
- Enhanced debugging for mobile issues
- More reliable image display on mobile

Error Handling:
- Mobile-specific abort event handling
- Enhanced retry attempt tracking
- Better timeout management for mobile
- Improved fallback mechanisms
- Mobile-optimized error recovery

Ready for reliable mobile image loading!"
