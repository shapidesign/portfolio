3. Remove loading indicator when complete
4. Show actual images or placeholders
5. Provide clear feedback for failed loads

Text alignment:
- Project descriptions now right-justified
- Consistent alignment across all projects
- Better visual hierarchy
- Improved readability

Error handling:
- Timeout for slow-loading images
- Placeholder images for failed loads

- Graceful degradation for large files

Mobile and desktop:
- Consistent image display across devices
- Same placeholder system for both layouts
- Improved loading feedback
- Better error handling

Ready for reliable image display!"
